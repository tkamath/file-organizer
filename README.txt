This project is a file system organizer that, upon being run, prompts the user for the source path of some source folder on the user's machine. The program then asks the user to enter a name for a new destination folder. After this, the program traverses the contents (including any nested folders) of the source folder and copies all non-directory files into the new destination folder.
